## Objective

The Security SIG provides a neutral home for discussion around designs, specifications, shared code and processes to enable security across the software supply chain. Topics of interest include the following:

Observability- enable actions performed while writing code, compiling, testing, and distributing software to be manifest and verifiable.
Policy - enable consumers of software to specify and implement policy over consumed software.
Inventory - enable administrators to inventory and audit software used within their organizations.
Runtime Security - enable detection and prevention of software tampering at runtime.
Vulnerability Communication - provide mechanisms for breaches in the integrity of software to be communicated and remediated.
Vulnerability Recovery - provide mechanisms for consumers to recover from compromised or untrusted software.
