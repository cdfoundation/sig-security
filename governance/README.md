SIG-Security is a [CDF Special Interest Group](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/tree/master/sigs).

* [Charter](charter.md) - mission and scope
* [Roles](roles.md) - the work of the group is facilited by Chairs, Technical Leads, and active group members
* [Process](process.md) - how projects are proposed and work is tracked

General meetings are posted on the CDF calendar and serve as a forum for creating a shared understanding of the continuous delivery security landscape with regular updates by members on project progress and their own security-related, with on-going discovery through guest presentations.
